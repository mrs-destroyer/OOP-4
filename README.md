# Python Collections
Collections in python are basically container data types, namely lists, sets, tuples, dictionary. They have different characteristics based on the declaration and the usage. 

# Counters
Python Counter is a container that will hold the count of each of the elements present in the container. The counter is a sub-class available inside the dictionary class. 

# OrderedDict
Python's OrderedDict is a dict subclass that preserves the order in which key-value pairs, commonly known as items, are inserted into the dictionary. When we iterate over an OrderedDict object, items are traversed in the original order. If we update the value of an existing key, then the order remains unchanged.

# Defaultdict
The defaultdict tool is a container in the collections class of Python. It has one difference The value fields' data type is specified upon initialization. In other words defaultdict(int) - the argument int indicates that the values will be int type.

# ChainMap
A ChainMap class is provided for quickly linking a number of mappings  It is often much faster than creating a new dictionary and running multiple update() calls. 

# NamedTuple
Python's namedtuple() is a factory function . It allows us to create tuple subclasses with named fields. We can access the values in a given named tuple using the dot notation and the field names, like in obj. attr.

# DeQue
A deque is a double-ended queue in which elements can be both inserted and deleted from either the left or the right end of the queue. An implementation of a deque in the collections module.

# Heap
A heap is created by using python's inbuilt library named heapq. This library has the relevant functions to carry out various operations on heap data structure.

# Collections.UserDict
UserDict in Python. An unordered collection of data values that are used to store data values like a map is known as Dictionary in Python. Unlike other Data Types that hold only a single value as an element, Dictionary holds key:value pair.

# Collections.UserList
UserList is a class provided by the collections module in Python. Who acts as a wrapper around the built-in list type.

# Collections.UserString
 UserString is a class provided by the "collections" module in Python. It offering additional functionality and customization options.
